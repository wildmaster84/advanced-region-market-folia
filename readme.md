AdvancedRegionMarket is a plugin for the Minecraft server API called Spigot.
The plugin allows server admins to sell or rent in-game regions to players using in-game currency.
To achieve this AdvancedRegionMarket integrates with [WorldGuardFolia](https://github.com/wildmaster84/WorldGuardFolia)
which defines regions, [WorldEdit](https://github.com/wildmaster84/FastAsyncWorldEdit) which is used to restore regions
and [Vault](https://github.com/SirBlobman/Vault-Folia) which provides an API to communicate with in-game
currency plugins.

Find more information about the plugin on its download page on [SpigotMC.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedregionmarket.58732/)
